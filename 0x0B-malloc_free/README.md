# 0x0B. C - malloc, free

## Tasks

0. Write a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.

    * Returns NULL if size = 0
    * Returns a pointer to the array, or NULL if it fails

1. Write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.

    * The \_strdup() function returns a pointer to a new string which is a duplicate of the string str. Memory for the new string is obtained with malloc, and can be freed with free.
    * Returns NULL if str = NULL
    * On success, the \_strdup function returns a pointer to the duplicated string. It returns NULL if insufficient memory was available
	* FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strdup. Run man strdup to learn more.

2. Write a function that concatenates two strings.

    * The returned pointer should point to a newly allocated space in memory which contains the contents of s1, followed by the contents of s2, and null terminated
    * if NULL is passed, treat it as an empty string
    * The function should return NULL on failure

3. Write a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.

    * Each element of the grid should be initialized to 0
    * The function should return NULL on failure
    * If width or height is 0 or negative, return NULL

4. Write a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function.

    * Note that we will compile with your alloc_grid.c file. Make sure it compiles.

100. Write a function that concatenates all the arguments of your program.

    * Returns NULL if ac == 0 or av == NULL
    * Returns a pointer to a new string, or NULL if it fails
    * Each argument should be followed by a \\n in the new string

101. Write a function that splits a string into words.

    * The function returns a pointer to an array of strings (words)
    * Each element of this array should contain a single word, null-terminated
    * The last element of the returned array should be NULL
    * Words are separated by spaces
    * Returns NULL if str == NULL or str == ""
    * If your function fails, it should return NULL


6. Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.

7. Write a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.

	* An empty string is a palindrome
8. Write a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.

	* s2 can contain the special character \*.
	* The special char \* can replace any string (including an empty string)
